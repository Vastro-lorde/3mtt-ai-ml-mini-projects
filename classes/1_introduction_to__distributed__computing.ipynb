        "Welcome to the world of **Big Data and Cloud Computing**! Over the next 3 weeks, weâ€™ll explore how to handle massive amounts of data, process it efficiently, and use cloud platforms to scale your data science projects. Think of this as learning how to manage a library thatâ€™s growing faster than you can imagine, and using super-powered tools to organize and analyze it all.\n",

        "Imagine you have a giant puzzle to solve, but itâ€™s too big for one person to handle. Distributed computing is like splitting the puzzle into smaller pieces and giving each piece to a different person to solve. Once everyone finishes, you combine the results to see the full picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the tech world, **Hadoop** and **Spark** are like the team leaders that help you split and process big data across multiple computers.\n",

        "### **Hadoop**\n",
        "- **What it does**: Hadoop is like a librarian who stores and organizes books (data) in a big library (cluster of computers).\n",
        "- **Key Components**:\n",
        "  - **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: Stores data across multiple machines.\n",
        "  - **MapReduce**: Processes data in parallel across the cluster.\n",

        "#### **Example: Counting Words in a Book**\n",
        "Letâ€™s say you want to count how many times the word \"data\" appears in a giant book. Hadoop splits the book into chapters, gives each chapter to a different computer, and then combines the results.\n",
