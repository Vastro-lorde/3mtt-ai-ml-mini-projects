    "### **Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow**\n",
    "- **What it does**: Airflow is like a factory conveyor belt for data. It automates workflows, ensuring data flows smoothly from one step to the next.\n",
    "- **Why use Airflow?**: Itâ€™s great for scheduling and monitoring complex data pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Daily Sales Report**\n",
    "Imagine you need to generate a daily sales report. Airflow can automate the process:\n",
    "1. Extract data from a database.\n",
    "2. Transform the data (e.g., calculate totals).\n",
    "3. Load the report into a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Airflow DAG example\n",
    "from airflow import DAG\n",
    "from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "def extract():\n",
    "    print(\"Extracting data...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def transform():\n",
    "    print(\"Transforming data...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def load():\n",
    "    print(\"Loading data...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the DAG\n",
    "dag = DAG(\"daily_sales\", description=\"Daily Sales Report\", schedule_interval=\"0 0 * * *\", start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 1))\n",

    "### **Cloud Platforms for Data Science**\n",
    "- **What they do**: Cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure** provide tools and infrastructure to store, process, and analyze big data.\n",
    "- **Why use the cloud?**: Itâ€™s scalable, cost-effective, and accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Storing Data on AWS S3**\n",
    "Letâ€™s say you want to store a large dataset. AWS S3 is like a giant, secure hard drive in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Uploading a file to AWS S3 using Boto3\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to S3\n",
    "s3 = boto3.client(\"s3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Upload a file\n",
    "s3.upload_file(\"large_data.csv\", \"my-bucket\", \"large_data.csv\")\n",
    "print(\"File uploaded to S3!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "Congratulations! Youâ€™ve learned the basics of big data and cloud computing. Now you can:\n",
    "- Use Hadoop and Spark to process large datasets.\n",
    "- Work with PySpark and Dask for scalable data analysis.\n",
    "- Automate workflows with Apache Airflow.\n",
    "- Leverage cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, big data is like a treasure chestâ€”once you know how to unlock it, the possibilities are endless!\n",
